Downloading from the GitLab repository creates a directory structure as follows:

gronor --- src            (source directory with sub-directories)
        |
	-- include        (with a few include files)
	|
	-- CMakeLists.txt (the cmake build file)


To build, do the following within the gronor directory;

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake [flags] ../
4. make -j 10

This will expand the directory structure as follows:

gronor --- src            (source directory with sub-directories)
        |
	-- include        (with a few include files)
	|
	-- CMakeLists.txt (the cmake build file)
	|
	-- build --- bin  (directory with the gronor binary)
	          |
		  -- lib  (directory with the gronor libraries)
		  |
		  -- CMakeFiles  (cmake files created during build)


The following rules need to be followed for the src subdirectories:

1. programs in a single source file in a subdirectory with the same name
2. library files in a subdirectory will be in a single library


Build flags are the following:

--DMPI=ON is required as GronOR requires a minimum of 2 MPI ranks to run
--DACC=ON will activate OpenACC directives to be interpreted for PGI compilers
