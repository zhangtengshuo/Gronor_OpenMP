Downloading from the GitLab repository:

git clone --recursive git@gitlab.com:gronor/gronor.git

To check out the stable version 3 branch of gronor:

git checkout gronor3

The initial directory structure is as follows:

gronor --- src            (source directory with sub-directories)
        |
	-- aux            (auxiliary programs to interface with OpenMolcas)
        |
	-- include        (with a few include files)
        |
	-- examples       (example input files for full OpenMolcas/GronOR runs)
        |
	-- scripts        (scripts directorye)
	|
	-- CMakeLists.txt (the cmake build file)
	|
	-- CTestConfig.cmake (cmake script to setup automated testing)


To build, do the following within the gronor directory;

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake [flags] ../
4. make -j 10

This will expand the directory structure as follows:

gronor --- src               (source directory with sub-directories)
        |
	-- aux               (auxiliary programs to interface with OpenMolcas)
        |
	-- include           (with a few include files)
        |
	-- examples          (example input files for full OpenMolcas/GronOR runs)
        |
	-- scripts           (scripts directorye)
	|
	-- CMakeLists.txt    (the cmake build file)
	|
	-- CTestConfig.cmake (cmake script to setup automated testing)
	|
	-- build --- bin     (directory with the gronor binary)
	          |
		  -- lib     (directory with the gronor libraries)
		  |
		  -- CMakeFiles  (cmake files created during build)


The following rules need to be followed for the src subdirectories:

1. programs in a single source file in a subdirectory with the same name
2. library files in a subdirectory will be in a single library


Build flags are the following:

-DMPI=ON is default as GronOR requires a minimum of 2 MPI ranks to run
-DOPENACC=ON will activate OpenACC directives to be interpreted for PGI compilers 
-DOPENMP=ON will activate OpenMP directives to be interpreted for most compilers
-DCUDA=ON will activate basic access required for CUSOLVER and/or CUSOLVERJ 
-DCUSOLVER=ON will activate the CUSOLVER library, and requires -DOPENACC=ON
-DCUSOLVERJ=ON will activate the CUSOLVER library including the iterative Jacobi solvers, and requires -DOPENACC=ON
-DMKL=ON will link against MKL libraries for compatible compilers

GronOR is interfaced with OpenMolcas for integrals and CASSCF orbital coefficients.
Some minor changes in the OpenMolcas source code are required for GronOR to properly 
function per the instructions in the file OpenMolcas-GronOR.pdf.
